Nuxt AEO is a Nuxt module that supports AI Engine Optimization (AEO) through Schema.org JSON-LD.

## What is AEO?

**AI Engine Optimization (AEO)** is a technique for optimizing structured data so that AI models (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, etc.) and search engines can better understand web content and provide accurate answers to user questions.

With this module, you can:

- 🤖 **AI Model Optimization**: AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity can use structured data when crawling and understanding content to provide more accurate information and citations
- 🔍 **Search Engine Optimization**: Search engines like Google and Bing can display your content in Featured Snippets, Knowledge Graph, etc.
- 📊 **Answer Engine Optimization**: Optimize for search engines and AI models to provide direct answers to user questions

## Quick Start

### 1. Basic Usage

Once installed, you can use it right away. The simplest example is adding a Schema to an FAQ page:


```vue [pages/example.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
useSchemaPage({
  mainEntity: [
    {
      name: 'What is the Nuxt AEO module?',
      acceptedAnswer: {
        text: 'Nuxt AEO is a Nuxt module that supports AI Engine Optimization (AEO) through Schema.org JSON-LD.'
      }
    }
  ]
})
</script>
```


### 2. Verify

Open Developer Tools (F12) and check the Elements tab for a JSON-LD script tag like this:
